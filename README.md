## Inspiration
Hundreds of farmers in Madhya Pradesh's Betul district, who had entered a contract for drumstick farming in 2018, are now fighting to get a case registered against a company that disappeared after allegedly cheating them.
The Rising Frauds against Farmers was our inspiration to help them.
We found two major problems that farmers face:
<ul>
<li>Not in their native language</li>
<li>Complex Language which with long text</li>
</ul>
